# Why would a containerized version of an application be beneficial if you can run the application locally already?
* It increases portability between different platforms. 
* You run it once anywhere from any platform. 
* Easier to integrate team changes to the project.

# If we have the ability to publish directly to Heroku, why involve a CI solution like CircleCI? What benefit does it provide?
* CircleCi provides a huge benefit to any project by running automated tests when changes have been made to the project. 
* This minimizes integration issues a project may have. This is a benefit I believe only CIâ€™s like CircleCI has.
